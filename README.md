# Haskell code to accompany Types and Programming Languages (TAPL)

TAPL comes with OCaml examples. However, to help my understanding and
because I am learning Haskell, I have implemented some of them 
in Haskell.


Modern OCaml implementations of the examples are available from
https://github.com/mspertus/TAPL/tree/main


## Main.hs

Contains a lexer, parser and interpreter for the "arithmetic" language 
defined in Chapter 3 in under 100 lines of Haskell
